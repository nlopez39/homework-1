# Homework-1

## Description

This is the Module 1 Challenge, which was given to the bootcamp students for Week 1. It contains edits to both the HTML and CSS code that was provided. Students were asked to make the code more accessible/user friendly. To do this I made edits to the HTML tags and replaced most of the `divs` with semantic tags. 
I also made changes to the CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## Installation

To install this onto your local computer: 
1. In your terminal, choose a folder that you would like to copy these files into (ex. `cd bootcamp`)
2. In GitHub, click the `Code` button and copy the `SSH key` to your clipboard. 
3. In your terminal, make a copy of the repository by using `git clone` and paste in the `SSH key` (`command + v`)
4. Now you should have a copy of this repository in your 'bootcamp' folder


## Usage

To see how the semantic tags are helping the HTML code look user friendly- either open the index.html file in VS code or open it in a default browser. 

If using the default browser option: 
1. Right click the file and choose `Open in Default Browser`
2. In the broswer, right click the page and choose `Investigate`
3. Then the HTML code will pop up on the screen for you to play around with it.
